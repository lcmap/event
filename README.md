## About [&#x219F;](#contents)

The Land Change Monitoring Assessment and Projection (LCMAP) system will
provide the science community with real-time access to decades of Landsat
Analysis Ready Data (ARD). A key aspect of that system is the ability to
provide continuous monitoring of land change, and the LCMAP Event System
addresses this need.


## Documentation [&#x219F;](#contents)
